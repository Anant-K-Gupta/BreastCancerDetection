# Breast Cancer Prediction

An attempt at exploring the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set available on kaggle [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?datasetId=180&sortBy=voteCount 'Link to Data-Set' ).

After creating some visualisations to get a better idea of the data-set I used various Machine Learning models to try and predict wether the cancer is beging or malignant.
